## Hey, I'm Charles

I'm a web developer with a background in Biblical Hebrew ‚Äî which explains why my Github may seem a little strange to you.

I'll break it down a little more below but know that I love creating software, especially for the web that makes people's lives better.

## Web Developer

I love working on the web. The whole stack is fun! From databases to servers to the frontend.

**Some web things I'm proud of üéâ**

- This [example of using a scroll driven animation](https://codepen.io/charles-loder/pen/jOjJboP?editors=0100) ‚öôÔ∏è
- The docs for the [transliteration library](https://github.com/charlesLoder/hebrew-transliteration); all the docs are written as doc comments and Typescript types, and the build pipeline converts it to an Astro site using Starlight.
- A [full stack, MVC app](https://github.com/charlesLoder/mvc-library) written from the ground up; I used some new tech like Drizzle and Hono and some old tech like Sqlite to build an MVC app from the ground up. It was a fun learning experience.
- This [blog post](https://dev.to/charlesloder/modern-css-hamburger-using-has-2ijc) on using the new CSS `:has()` selector to create a modern hamburger menu.

## Hebraist

My background is in historical linguistics, particularly Biblical Hebrew. I wrote a Master's thesis about [two pronouns in Hebrew](https://www.academia.edu/27562501/An_I_For_an_I_The_First_Person_Common_Singular_Pronoun_in_Biblical_Hebrew). This is why so many of my repo's are about Hebrew or some other ancient language.

**Some Hebrew things I'm proud of üéâ**

- The [transliteration library](https://github.com/charlesLoder/hebrew-transliteration). I've worked on this library as long as I've been coding. It's gone from a script tag to a fully typed, CJS and ESM compatible library.
- The syllabification library [havarotjs](https://github.com/charlesLoder/havarotjs) which is a dependency  of the transliteration library.
- A [published paper on Phoenician](https://www.academia.edu/40245436/THE_SHORT_FORM_OF_THE_PHOENICIAN_FIRST_PERSON_INDEPENDENT_PRONOUN_REASSESSED_PREPUB_).

## Problem Solver

What draws the two above together is my love of solving problems. Whether it is making a complex app or creating simple components, wherever there is a challenge, I want to solve it!
